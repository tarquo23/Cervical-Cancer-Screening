# Cervical-Cancer-Screening

This project is inspired by the Intel-sponsored Kaggle challenge to prevent cervical cancer. In our study, my colleague Federico Vasile and I have tried to apply various neural networks to the dataset and by applying various techniques we have explored their potential trying to improve more and more the results obtained. The methods treated and the results, as well as their evaluation, are described in detail in the attached report.

Convolutional Neural Networks

Python, Keras, Pythorch
